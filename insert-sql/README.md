# Insert-SQL Script

This script is designed to execute a post-migration SQL script after a database migration process. It provides two methods for specifying database connection details:

â€“ **Method 1: Hardcoded Credentials**

The script includes pre-defined variables for database connection details, including `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, and `DB_PORT`. You can replace these placeholders with your actual database credentials.

- **Method 2: Using a `.env` File (Recommended)**

The script demonstrates loading environment variables from a separate `.env` file using the `load-env.sh` script (assumed to be located in a `load-env` subdirectory within the project directory). This approach is recommended for improved security practices, as it avoids storing sensitive credentials directly in the script.

## Instructions

1. **Choose your preferred method:**

   - **Hardcoded Credentials:** Update the pre-defined variables (`DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, and `DB_PORT`) with your actual database credentials.
   - **Using a `.env` File:**

     - Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
     - Add your database connection details to the `.env` file in the following format (one variable per line):

     ```env
     DB_NAME=your_database_name
     DB_USER=your_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     DB_HOST=your_host
     DB_PORT=your_port
     ```

     - Ensure the `load-env.sh` script has executable permissions (`chmod +x $DIR/../load-env/load-env.sh`).

2. **Update the SQL file path:**

   - Replace the placeholder `"$DIR/../sql/post-migration.sql"` with the actual path to your post-migration SQL file.

3. **Run the script:**

   - Execute the script from your terminal:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

## Security Considerations

- The recommended approach is to use a `.env` file to store your database credentials. This keeps your credentials separate from the script itself, reducing the risk of exposure.
- Remember to grant appropriate execution permissions to the `load-env.sh` script if using the `.env` file method.

## Output

The script will execute the specified SQL file and display a message indicating success or failure.

I hope this README provides a clear explanation of the post-migration script and its usage!
